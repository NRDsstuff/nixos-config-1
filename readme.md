# CatNowBlue's NixOS configuration

NixOS vanilla plus home manager config, including NVIDIA proprietary driver plus OPTIMUS Prime functionality.

This configuration is for my laptop: ASUS TUF Gaming F15 (exact model: FX506HE)

Similar model may work, but you need to modify the BUS

This isn't really a complete configuration, only modifies the configuration generated from NixOS GNOME (version 23.11)

You can import `main.nix` in your `configuration.nix`.<br>
